handler will be a generic class that can be extended by specific implementations for each of the baselines ...

Should be able to do:

- load a model from a path

- project image into a latent, measure speed
- project latent into a reconstruction, measure speed




(will be used by?)
- can use a renderer - which shows results and fps
- can use a camera - which takes images and feeds them in (maybe zooms to face with dlib)


(later)
- can do alpha-blend between two models
   - in: model1, model2, alpha
   - will be used by something else, maybe blender ?


(parent will know how to)
- save image
- load image
- input camera
- output renderer

- load from folder

- save to folder
